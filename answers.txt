With smaller pulse widths, the pulse resonant waveform varied more than when the pulse widths were greater. There were also many more significant peaks
in the FFT graph with the smaller pulse width.

A variation of acquisition rate does not appear to change the results.
The minimum scan rate to get values for 2000Hz is 4000 samples/second.  The minimum buffer size to get
values for 2000Hz is 12, but the data is not likely reliable with so few samples.
Data starts to look more reasonable with a buffer size of 32, and data looks fairly good at
a buffer size of 100.

With varying the average, we cannot distinguish any major changes in the graph.

When we run our data through the ResonanceAnalyzer.vi, we get amp = 0.02804;  Q = 16;  Max Frequency = 160
