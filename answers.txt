With smaller pulse widths, the pulse resonant waveform varied more than when the pulse widths were greater. There were also many more significant peaks
in the FFT graph with the smaller pulse width.

A variation of acquisition rate does not appear to change the results.

With varying the average, we cannot distinguish any major changes in the graph.
